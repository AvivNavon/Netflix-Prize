# Netflix Prize

Welcome :)

This is a private repository. 


## Some more ideas

1. SVD++ - a matrix factorization method: we can use this on the initial data set (with missing values). The is a Python implementation here: https://github.com/NicolasHug/Surprise

2. RBM: this method was used in the actual Netflix competition, and might give good results: https://github.com/echen/restricted-boltzmann-machines
